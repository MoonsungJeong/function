Ajax with NodeJs


There are 8 files in this project.

There is a server file("server.js") with extra file("time.js")

There are 4 type of client files("start1","start2","start3","start4".html)

There are "chrome.txt" and "this file".


You have to use command in "chrome.txt" to open chrome browser, If you run this project in localhost.

Probably you don't need to use it, if you run this project in public server and independant client.



start1.html(First file) is about Ajax Get request from browser and Response from Server

start2.html(Second file) is about Ajax Post request from browser and Response from Server

start3.html(Third file) is about Ajax Get request with Parameter from browser and time Response(time.js) from Server

start4.html(Fourth file) is about Ajax Post request with JSON from browser and Response from Server

Version 2

I used "res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")" to fix CORS(Cross-origin resource sharing) policy.

you don't need to use command in "chrome.txt" to open chrome browser anymore
