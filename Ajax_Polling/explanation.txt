There are 6 files in this project.

There is a server file("server.js")

There are 3 type of client files("index.html", "script.js", "style.css")

There are "chrome.txt" and "this file".


You have to use command in "chrome.txt" to open chrome browser, If you run this project in localhost.

Probably you don't need to use it, if you run this project in public server and independant client.



"index.html" is client html file

"sciprt.js" has actual code of Ajax connection from Browser

"style.css" is css file

"server.js" is NodeJs server file
